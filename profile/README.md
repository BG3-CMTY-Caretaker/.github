## BG3 CMTY Caretaker

The CMTY Caretaker is a Github organization that hosts, with the author's consent, the source for orphaned mods(mods whose author is no able to or interested in maintaining) for Baldur's Gate 3. 

## Submitting mods to the Caretaker
If you would like your mod to be hosted here, please contact the BG3 Modding Community ModMail with proof of authorship, the source files for the mod in question, and a document outlining your wishes for the work (e.g. licensing, anything that would cause a breach in permissions).

### Proof of Authorship 
The following may be considered Proof of Authorship
- A Direct Message to one of the BG3MC staff via Nexus Mods
- (TODO: Determine additional ways)

### Licensing
If you have any conditions on how you would like the mod to be developed, please provide a Text or Markdown document for any of the following:
- A License (ex. MIT, GPL, etc)
- A code of conduct

## Picking up mods from the caretaker
If you are interested in picking up a mod from the caretaker, you should fork the specific mod's repository from the caretaker, and build off of your fork. Repositories held by the Caretaker will generally be considered frozen-in-time - no pull requests to the caretaker repo will be accepted unless from the submitting author.
